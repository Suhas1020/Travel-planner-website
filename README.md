My DBMS project revolves around developing a user-friendly travel planner website.
It empowers users to book various destinations while customizing preferences like location type, budget, and desired facilities.
With a simple interface and comprehensive options, planning your dream trip becomes effortless.
This project is constructed utilizing HTML and CSS for frontend design and styling, while PHP and MySQL drive backend functionalities and handle database management.
